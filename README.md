DiskExperiment
==============

Random experiments that re-invent the wheel for the purpose of learning about wheels.

While the general idea was to implement a key-value store with log structured merge trees, in actuality
it will probably just end up as a disconnected set of experiments for learning purposes.

P.S. If you landed here looking for a real implementation, try LevelDB instead.
